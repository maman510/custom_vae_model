Certainly! The KL divergence (KL) term in variational autoencoders (VAEs) is often scaled by a factor called the "KL weight," which can be adjusted during training. One common approach is to increase this weight gradually to encourage the model to learn a good latent distribution over time. This can be based on reconstruction error, meaning that as the model's reconstruction error improves, the KL term is more heavily weighted.

### Example of a KL Beta Update Schedule Based on Reconstruction Error

Let’s assume you want to adjust the KL weight (β) dynamically based on reconstruction error, which typically decreases over time as the model gets better at reconstructing the data. Here's how the β parameter can be adjusted:

1. **Initial Stage**: During the early stages of training, the KL divergence term is weighted less (small β), as we want the model to focus more on reconstructing the data accurately.
2. **Intermediate Stage**: As the reconstruction error decreases (i.e., the model gets better at reconstruction), the KL term is weighted more.
3. **Final Stage**: By the end of training, the model should balance reconstruction error and latent space regularization (KL divergence), so β reaches its final value.

#### Table: Example of KL Beta Update Schedule Based on Reconstruction Error

| Epoch Range        | Reconstruction Error (mean) | KL Beta Weight (β) | Notes                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 - 50             | High (e.g., 1.0)             | 0.1                | Focus on reconstruction, minimal KL    |
| 51 - 100           | Medium (e.g., 0.8)           | 0.2                | Begin increasing KL weight as error improves |
| 101 - 150          | Medium-Low (e.g., 0.6)       | 0.4                | KL term is more important as the model stabilizes |
| 151 - 200          | Low (e.g., 0.4)              | 0.6                | KL term grows stronger; better balance |
| 201 - 300          | Very Low (e.g., 0.2)         | 0.8                | Final stages, strong regularization with KL |
| 301+               | Very Low (e.g., 0.1)         | 1.0                | Focus on regularizing the latent space |

### Key Points:
- **Reconstruction error** decreases over time, so we gradually shift more weight to the KL term to enforce a more regularized latent space.
- The KL weight β starts small and increases progressively, depending on how well the model is performing in terms of reconstruction.
- You could adjust the rate at which β increases based on how quickly reconstruction error improves.

### Why this works:
- Initially, we want the model to focus primarily on minimizing the reconstruction error without worrying too much about the latent space structure (hence the small β).
- As reconstruction improves, we begin placing more emphasis on the KL term to ensure the latent variables have the desired distribution (often a normal distribution).
- The final stage of training focuses on regularizing the latent space, ensuring that the latent variables follow the prior distribution, which can improve generalization.

This schedule can be fine-tuned depending on the specifics of the dataset and the model's performance.
